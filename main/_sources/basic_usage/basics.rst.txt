Basic Usage
===========

To start Heinrich, lay him flat on the ground - if the legs are not in the correct position, he will not turn on! Once he is flat, insert the battery. There is a wrong and a right side, so don't force it in, just turn it around.
Then, press the power button on the battery once briefly and then again for at least two seconds to turn Heinrich on. The power button is located on the battery, not on Heinrich himself. Now Heinrich will start booting, which takes a minute. 
When he's ready, he will stand up (so don't stand over him!).

To connect the app, we recommend the hotspot option. This means Heinrich creates a hotspot you then connect to. Our standard settings are hotspot name "Robo" and password "Heinrich".

For firmware updates, the WiFi connection option is required. Please note: Heinrich doesn't have many configuration options! 
The best way we have found is to use a hotspot. Best practice is to share the LAN connection from your laptop with simple password protection and then connect both your phone and the dog.

The app has the most comprehensive options and is the most user-friendly way to interact with Heinrich. For usage with the two remotes, please see the respective pages.
